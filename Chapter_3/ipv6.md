# Internet Protocol Version 6

The original IPv4 when built never predicted the widespread use of the internet as we see
today. IPv6 is designed to take over from the IPv4 standard to become the most widely used
network protocol layer. The IPv4 has a very small address space and would have been exhausted
already if not for classless addressing and NAT.
